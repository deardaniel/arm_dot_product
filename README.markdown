Assignment &mdash; Implementation of dot product calculation on ARM
=============================================================
***4810-1164 Modern Computer Architectures and System Software, Summer 2011***


This is iOS project to demonstration ARMv6 and ARMv7 (using NEON) assembly programming.

Currently all floating point operations are dependent on NEON and therefore do not compile for ARMv6.

Nothing much to see here yet. Check out `ARM/dot_product.s` in the meantime.

Assignment &mdash; Implementation of dot product calculation on ARM
===================================================================


This is iOS project to demonstration ARMv6 and ARMv7 (using NEON) assembly programming.

Currently all floating point operations are dependent on NEON and therefore do not compile for ARMv6.

Nothing much to see here yet. Check out `ARM/dot_product.s` in the meantime.
